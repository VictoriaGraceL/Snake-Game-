🐍 Java Snake Game
📚 Project Overview
This is a Java-based Snake Game created using Swing and AWT for the graphical interface. It is a fun and interactive project that demonstrates the use of:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

GUI development with Java Swing

Game loops and real-time rendering

Event-driven programming (keyboard input handling)

The game is fully playable using the arrow keys and includes basic scoring, collision detection, and game-over logic.

🎮 Game Features
Classic Snake movement and growth

Real-time snake speed using a game loop

Random food generation

Game over detection when hitting the wall or self-collision

Score tracking displayed on screen
